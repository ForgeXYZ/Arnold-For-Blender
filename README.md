# Update 9/28/19

Hey, we've been busy as usual, everything is going steadily:

- We have done some nice improvements to depsgraph to make exporting viewport updates nice and snappy.

- Rounded out some UI changes, for a smoother workflow experience.

- Have made the rendered viewport feel much more interactive overall and updated to Arnold's latest rendering API.

- We have implemented all the Arnold nodes including the latest `clip_geo_shader`.

- Have a solid `.ass` export working, and are working on getting a `.ass` importer working along with the new api for operators.

- The additional enhancements for previewing arnold scenes to make heavy production scenes more manageable.

- Support for previewing different AOVs in the rendered viewport as well as AOV support for final render.

Also to add, I have gotten questions regarding the beta and whether this addon would support blender 2.80, the addon only supports blender 2.80 and all future versions of blender, we have no interest in supporting 2.79 as of now, but if we get requests for it we might look back into supporting 2.79.

Within regards to the beta, it will be closed and a select number of individuals will be recieving the download for it, as we do not want the beta version wandering off into production settings, and want the overall experience to be as smooth as possible for all of our users.

# Arnold GPU, Rendered Viewport, automatic installer and more. Will post the official release link right here when it's ready! Windows, Linux, and macOS are all supported.
